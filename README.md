# renovate-config

Shared [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) config for my repos, hosted as a
[preset](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/).

## Usage

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": ["github>hugoh/renovate-config"]
}
```

Repos with their own additional rules (version pins, extra managers, etc.) list
`github>hugoh/renovate-config` first in their `extends` array and add their own
`packageRules` afterward.

### `presets/action-repo` and `presets/action-file`

Repos that release from conventional commits need dependency bumps typed
`fix` (not `chore`) so `cog bump --auto` cuts a release. Extend one of:

- `github>hugoh/renovate-config//presets/action-repo` — **every**
  github-actions bump is `fix`. For repos whose CI content *is* the
  released artifact (reusable-workflow repos: `gh-workflows`,
  `spoon-tools`).
- `github>hugoh/renovate-config//presets/action-file` — only a bump to
  the published `action.yml` is `fix`. For composite-action repos
  (`cog-bump`, `digest-action`, `rerun-transient-failures`).

### The Go cluster

`go-tools/go-renovaterc.json` intentionally does **not** extend this
preset wholesale — it encodes a deliberately more conservative policy for
the Go cluster. It does reuse the `vulnerability-alerts`
fragment, since that's identical across both clusters. `spoon-tools/default.json`
extends this preset directly and layers a `lua` version ceiling on top.
